## Project Details

### Objective
The goal of this project is to create an entire web page based on a provided design. This includes using HTML to structure the content, CSS to style it, and Flexbox to achieve the layout.

### Instructions
1. **Design Reference:** 
    - Full design ![Image One: Full Design](./readme-images/full-design.png), 
    - Colours and Fonts ![Image Two: Colour and Fonts](./readme-images/colours-fonts.png).
2. **Content and Structure:** Start by adding all the necessary HTML content for the web page.
3. **Styling:** Apply CSS styles to match the design as closely as possible. Use Flexbox to handle the layout.
4. **Sections:** The web page consists of 4 main sections and a footer. Tackle one section at a time, starting from the top.
5. **Hero Text:** Add the hero text that appears at the top of the page.
6. **Fonts and Colours:** Use the Roboto font and the colours specified in the design.
7. **Responsive Design:** Focus on desktop layout. Mobile responsiveness will be learned later.
8. **Personalisation:** Feel free to substitute your own content, images, colours, and fonts.
9. **Commit Often:** Regularly commit your changes with clear messages.
10. **Push to GitHub:** Once completed, push your project to GitHub.

### Additional Notes

- Feel free to play around and make the project your own with personalised content and styling.

## Conclusion

This project is an excellent opportunity to apply the skills learned in HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. By the end of this project, I will have a strong foundation in web development and the confidence to tackle more advanced projects.
